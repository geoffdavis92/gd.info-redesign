      <h3>What I can do...</h3>
      <article id="html"><span id="pseudo4"><span id="glyph">H</span>HTML5</span> &ndash; I am handy with HTML5<br><br><p id="desc">One of the benefits
      of starting my training when I did was getting on the initial curve of HTML5 iteration and integration, allowing me first-hand experience
      with the most up-to-date standards in Markup.</p></article>
      <article id="css"><span id="pseudo4"><span id="glyph">C</span>CSS</span> &ndash; I am sensational with CSS3<br><br><p id="desc">
      Again, I was lucky enough to start learning CSS just as CSS3 came out, ensuring that I was learning the latest iterations of the styling
      code. Recently I have been working with the SASS preprocessor. (<a href="http://www.sass-lang.org">link</a>) In fact, this site is made
      with SASS!</p></article>
      <article id="js"><span id="pseudo4"><span id="glyph">_</span>JavaScript</span> &ndash; I am just fine with JavaScript<br><br><p id="desc">
      Although my major track is web <i>design</i> rather than web <i>programming</i>, I have taken it upon myself to learn JavaScript. If you
      checked this site's source code, you've seen that the header and footer are both made with pure JavaScript!</p></article>
      <article id="type"><span id="pseudo4"><span id="glyph">T</span>&nbsp;&#9;Typography</span> &ndash; I am talented with Typography.<br><br>
        <p id="desc">Readability is everything, especially on the web. Luckily, with CSS3, the typographic tools that it has, and third-party tools
          like Google Fonts, best practices can be implemented to allow online readers the best experience possible.</p></article>
