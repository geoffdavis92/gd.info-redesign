      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Geoff Davis. I am a senior web design &amp; interactive media student. Upon my impending graduation
      in May of 2015, I will pursue employment opportunities pertaining to creating interactive and unique web spaces, including
      but not limited to web design, user experience, user interface, and development of interactive/responsive sites.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>From grades 9 through 12, I attended <a>Central High School</a> in <a>Crystal Lake, Illinois</a>. It was here that I first found interest
          in digital design, after taking a course in computer graphics; however, due to the lack of any web design courses, I focused many of my elective
          hours on social science and history.</p>
          <p>For my secondary education, I am attending <a>Harding University</a> in Searcy, Arkansas. As stated above, I am working
            towards a Bachelor of Arts in the field of Web Design &amp; Interactive Media, through the Department of Communication.</p>
          <p>Other than my degree, I have been involved in the social club process, acting as a Charter Member, Historian, and Vice President of Omega Phi as well as a Beau (honored
            male member of a girl's social club) for Delta Nu. I have also been involved in intramural sports, international programs, Spring Sing, and, starting
            this year, the Campus Activities Board.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>I was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Crystal Lake, IL. Since I was little, I enjoyed creating things and using my
          (some would say...overactive) imagination to have fun. I loved creating scenes and structures with LEGOs, playing with my large collection
          of Hot Wheels cars, and drawing.</p>
          <p>Apart from using my imagination and creativity, I enjoyed playing sports. Early on, I started playing tee-ball and soccer; I only continued with the
          latter, however. I have played soccer for as long as I can remember, and I met many of my childhood friends from the many soccer teams that I played on.</p>
