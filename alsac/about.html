        <p>"ALSAC" is an abbreviation of <i>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</i>; it is the
        fundraising organization for St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, and has been its exclusive
        fund-raising organization since 1957. It is the third largest healthcare related charity in the
        United States. The headquarters is located on the St. Jude campus in Memphis, Tennessee,
        in the National Executive Office. Its primary purpose is to raise the funds and build the awareness
        needed to sustain St. Jude.</p>
        <p>
        ALSAC was founded by Danny Thomas, in order to ensure that the hospital's dotors and scientists
        provide the best care and latest research to its patients and their families, without a family needing to
        receive a bill. Research and treatment of St. Jude costs about $1.9 million per day; ALSAC is the
        only way that St. Jude continues to operate.</p>
        <p>
        ALSAC supports the hospital via over 30,000 fund-raising activities, including the
        FedEx St. Jude Classic, Give Thanks Walk, Telethon, Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailing,
        and other events.</p>

        <h2>About St. Jude</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic
            diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment
            based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay.</p>
            <span id="qsource">St. Jude Mission</span>
          </blockquote>
        <p>St. Jude was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas, with help from Dr. Lemuel Diggs and close friend, Anthony Abraham, on the
          premise that "no child should die in the dawn of life".<p>

        <p>This idea resulted from a promise that Danny Thomas, a Maronite, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded.
          Thomas was a funny comedian, who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first
          child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit and put his last $7 in the offering bin. He prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus
          for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin.</p>

        <p>After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer. He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if he made him successful, he would
          one day build him a shrine; hebuilt St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor this promise.

          (Although it was named after Thomas's patron saint, St. Jude is not a
          Catholic hospital and not affiliated with any religious organization.)</p>

          <p>In 1957, Thomas founded the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities
          (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its
          doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open. Memphis was chosen at the
          suggestion of Roman Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas.</p>
        <p>Discoveries at St. Jude have completely changed how doctors treat children with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses.</p>

        <p>Since St. Jude was established, the survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer,
          has increased from 4 percent in 1962 to 94 percent today. During this time, the overall survival rate for childhood cancers has
          risen from 20 percent to 80 percent.</p>
        <p>St. Jude has treated children from across the United States and from more than 70 countries.
          Doctors across the world consult with St. Jude on their toughest cases.
          Also, St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide
          through the transfer of knowledge, technology and organizational skills.</p>
