        <h2>About ALSAC</h2>
        <p>"ALSAC" is an abbreviation of <i>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</i>; it is the
        fundraising organization for St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, and has been its exclusive
        fund-raising organization since 1957. It is the third largest healthcare related charity in the
        United States. The headquarters is located on the St. Jude campus in Memphis, Tennessee,
        in the National Executive Office. Its primary purpose is to raise the funds and build the awareness
        needed to sustain St. Jude.</p>
        <p>
        ALSAC was founded by Danny Thomas, in order to ensure that the hospital's dotors and scientists
        provide the best care and latest research to its patients and their families, without a family needing to
        receive a bill. Research and treatment of St. Jude costs about $1.9 million per day; ALSAC is the
        only way that St. Jude continues to operate.</p>
        <p>
        ALSAC supports the hospital via over 30,000 fund-raising activities, including the
        FedEx St. Jude Classic, Give Thanks Walk, Telethon, Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailing,
        and other events.</p>
